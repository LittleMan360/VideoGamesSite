    <h1 class="fw-bold">Why Video Games?</h1>
    <p class="text-secondary">
        Video games have always been more than just a hobby for me. They’re a mix of storytelling, challenge, 
        creativity, and problem-solving. Some games are relaxing, some are brutally difficult, some are emotional, 
        but all of them offer experiences you can’t really get anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p class="text-secondary">
        I love getting lost in good worlds, figuring out how systems work, experimenting with builds, or teaming up 
        with friends to take on something tough. Whether it’s a single-player story or a chaotic co-op session, 
        games are where I unwind, learn, and have fun.

                    I really enjoy breaking down how games are put together — difficulty curves, level layouts, build 
                    systems, rewards, and pacing. It’s cool seeing how dozens of small decisions add up to a really 
                    polished experience.

                    I love games that push you to improve — learning patterns, refining builds, mastering timing, or 
                    experimenting until something finally clicks. Tough games feel incredibly rewarding when you beat them.

                    and long-term progression that I really enjoy.
