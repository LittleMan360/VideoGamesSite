<h1>About Me � Dalton Towe</h1>
<p>Hi! I�m Dalton. I love building software and playing video games. I enjoy being in the world and experiencing the stories they create.
    I love a good story that can make you feel for characters and immerse you in a world. I also enjoy the challenge of games that require skill and strategy, and the creativity of games that allow you to build and customize your own experience.
